About Empire-DB
===============

The mission of Apache Empire-db is to provide an alternative approach to relational  
database access compared to Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) as offered by JDO and JPA.

Apache Empire-db is intended for developers who strive to have full SQL freedom when 
formulating queries and DML-Statements - without ever having to use string literals -
and who also wants to be able to control when and how statements are executed. 

Unlike other approaches, Empire-db does not rely on Java Annotations or Mapping-files
for building queries but rather uses a Java Object model that is easy to access and
extend. For Data Access and Data Interchange, developers can choose between traditional 
Java Beans and a more sophisticated dynamic interface are provided by Record and DataListEntries.

Empire-db is DBMS vendor independent and provides handlers for Oracle, Microsoft SQLServer, 
PostgreSQL, MySQL, HsqlDB, Derby, H2 and more.
