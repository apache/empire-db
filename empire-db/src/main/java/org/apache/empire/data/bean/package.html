This package contains implmentations of Empire's data and metadata interfaces for JavaBeans of Data Tranfer Objects (DTO's).
<p>
Metadata is provides using the classes BeanDomain, BeanClass and BeanProperty.<br>
It is recommended to derive a class from BeanDomain and provide a description for every contained class 
using a nested class derived from BeanClass. Then in each BeanClass' constructor define the list of properties
by using the add() Method, which will return a BeanProperty object. This may be stored in a final field for static 
metadata access.
</p><p>
The class BeanRecordProxy allows accessing JavaBean to DTO data though the Record interface defined in the 
org.apache.empire.data namespace.
